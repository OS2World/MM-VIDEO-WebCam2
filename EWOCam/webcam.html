Welcome to my Web Camera.<BR>
A WebCamera is a video camera, that takes pictures in intervals and shows them in the web.<BR>
My WebCamera is placed inside my office, looking through the window down to the Elbe river.<BR>
The Elbe is one of Germanys biggest rivers and connects Hamburg to the North Sea.<BR>
My office is in <A HREF="http://www.gkss.de/Geesthacht.html"> Geesthacht</A> at the <A HREF="http://www.gkss.de"> GKSS Research Center</A>, approx. 30km east of Hamburg.

<P>
EWOCam/2 takes timed camera snapshots and saves them as images to disk.<BR>
Primary I wrote this app for myself, but it came out that many OS/2 users want to have this, too...<BR>
<P>
<P>
EWOCam/2's current developement status:
<P>
The standard image format is OS/2 bitmap (.BMP). 
Resolution is 160 x 120, 24 bit color, should be possible to enhance it.
With a user exit file ("WCAMEXIT.CMD") it is possible to start a conversion program or manipulate
the bitmap after grabbing a new one. Native JPEG support is planned for the future.
<P>
You can <A HREF="ftp://wave.gkss.de/pub/os2/WebCam/">download here</A> EWOCam/2 or WebCam/2, the version for FAST Movie Machine II.
